= How can I customize the look & feel of the plugin? =
In your template you can custom create a directory called "CMA". Inside this directory you can place a structure that is similar to the one inside "cm-answers/views/frontend/". If the file is properly able to be found in your template's directory, then it will have priority over the default. Otherwise, the default file from our plugin directory will be used.
