== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Using an image already in my library =

WordPress will NOT create the new thumbnail size for images that existed before the installation of HD Quiz, only new ones. This is likely because on larger sites, this would take up vast amounts of server resources.

If you do not wish to simply re-upload any desired image from your library, then I would recommend using the [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/ "Regenerate Thumbnails") plugin (over 1 Million active installs). It will go through and recreate thumbnails for every single image in your library, ensuring that all images in your library can be used with HD Quiz.

With that siad, I do, however, have plans to integrate a solution that will work with images uploaded before the installation of HD Quiz.

= What's the difference betwen WP Pagination and jQuery Pagination? Which should I use? =

Unless you are a unique situation, I'd almost always recommend using jQuery Pagination as it provides more control for you and a better experiece for your users. WP Pagination should only be used if you are trying to increase your overall page views for ad revenue or something similar.

Please see [this article](https://harmonicdesign.ca/hd-quiz-pagination/ "HD Quiz Pagination") for a full writeup on what the two features are and how they differ.

= I have a feature request! =
Fantastic! I'm one of those cray programmers who loves a good challenge. Please submit your feature request here by using the **support** tab or leave a request of the [official HD Quiz plugin page](https://harmonicdesign.ca/hd-quiz/ "view the HD Quiz plugin page").
